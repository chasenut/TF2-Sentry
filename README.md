<br>
<br>

I started this project about in February, 2025, after Valve announced open-sourcing Team Fortress 2.<br>
TF2 was (and will be) my favourite shooter, I grew up with it, and I love it. <br>
It always had place in my heart. So here I am, to commit something to the community, I made this project
which includes self-made 3D CADs and some electronics. <br>
This took hundrets of hours to make, and spanned over 4 whole months to make.

<br>

**Feel free to do whatever you want with it!**


## Parts

<br>

Microcontroller: `ESP32`<br>
I'm using some standard servos and motors, as well as LEDs etc. <br>
All (electronic) parts can be purchased at [botland.com.pl](https://www.botland.com/pl).<br>
Everything (that could be) is 3D-printed. I made all models myself.<br>
All models should be in `parts/` directory.<br>

# Functionality & code

<br>

This project's goal was to create a **3D replica** of Sentry from our beloved game Team Fortress 2.
Code for this Sentry _(and wireless module (Wrangler), which is not finished)_ isn't ready or good, 
I would say it is trash and was assembled quickly just to test the turret. **Feel free** to make/submit
your own code for this project, you can use current one as reference. 

# Build

<br>

For building and deploying I use(d) **Visual Studio Code** plugin [Platformio](https://platformio.org/).
